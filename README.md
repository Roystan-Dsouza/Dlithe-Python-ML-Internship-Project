## Credit Card Fraud Detection Analysis using Python Machine Learning models

The main objective of the Credit Card Fraud Detection Analysis is to predict whether a transaction made with a credit card is a fraud or a non-fraud transaction.

The steps involved in the project are:

1. Exploring the dataset and visualizing as well as cleaning the data set.

2. Data preprocessing.

3. Building machine learning models.

4. Evaluating the models.

5. Tuning the parameters for better accuracy.

6. Upsampling- Upsampling (Balanced): Decide how many times the sample size of the minority class wants to be used and perform sampling with replacement in the minority class      and sampling without replacement in the majority class.

7. Final model creation and analysis outcome.

Final result of analysis:
The accuracy obtained is 94% (SVM-Support Vector Machine algorithm)
